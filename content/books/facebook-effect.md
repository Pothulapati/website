efinitely a good read, especially if you haven't been following a lot of news around Facebook and its companies, etc. The content in the first half of the book was definitely more interesting to me, as it gives a third person view of the core events that happened in Facebook's Growth like News-feed, etc. Definitely gives you an insider perspective (especially for good things.) Mark's view on acquisitions and his thinking around the core events was also interesting to know.

The one downside for me is, falling into the pray of showing a bias (during the bad things) and being too forgiving, as those stories are also told from the perspective of Facebook, the company.
