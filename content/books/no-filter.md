Very captivating read. The story has a nice arch on Instagrams journey. The initial parts before Facebook's acquisition were the most interesting part of the book, where the vision, culture of Instagram was discussed. The author does a great job on explaining why a decision was made by giving real examples of users, etc.

Definitely recommended!
