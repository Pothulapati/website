Overall, Found this book okay. Nvidia being a popular company (and so is Jensen) means that a lot of the
stories from the book are already told. Especially that the book only deals with the popular and pivotal stories.
But its still a good revision of all the things that Nvidia did right.

Some of the early stories are still new (where the book for me was most interesting). Jensens childhood also was quite
interesting, and the part about how Nvidia was started.

I'd still recommend it. Wish it dealt with more not so popular stories. Thats all.
