Great Book!

As snapchat is a bit low key compared to other social media companies. This book gives a great introduction to how snapchat was founded, and the vision that Evan had. Not only that, but the journey on how snapchat which was initially perceived as a toy, and later turning into a full blown business is well explained. The main interesting part to me was the explanation on how initial users perceived and used snapchat, that set the stage for future plans. Overall, An interesting read!
