### Hardware

- [Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x1/X1-Extreme-Gen-2/p/22TP2TXX1E2): Primary work device.
- [Logitech Brio](https://www.logitech.com/en-in/products/webcams/brio-4k-hdr-webcam.960-001105.html): Love it. Very useful not just for my work calls but also for my virtual workouts that I've been doing! Highly recommend a good webcam if you are working remotely! :)
- [Blue Yeti](https://www.blueyeti.com/): Primary microphone. A bit complex to setup sometimes, but the sound quality is great.
- [Elgato Keylight Air](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-air): Primarily use it when I'm doing meetings later in the day. Also, Nice to have good lighting when giving presentations or streaming.
- [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.sony.com/us/en/wireless-headphones/wh-1000xm4/p/WH1000XM4): Headphones
- [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.com/moonlander/): This was definitely one of those purchases where I went a little over board but I still consider it as a good purchase, considering how long I plan to use it.
- [Dell P Series montiors](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-in/monitors-for-work/p-series-monitors.htm): I have the P2719H and P2419H. Not a big fan of dual monitors but had to do this as I got the 24inch one initially. If I had to start from scratch now, I would probably go with a single monitor > 30 inches or a ultra-wide screen(heard they are too good!).

Some of these expensive hardware items were part of swags for speaking in virtual conferences, and I'm very thankful because of their long term impact. (P.S: If you are conference organizer, please incentivize your speakers)

### Software

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/): Use it! Awesome way to have reproducable environments. Happy that I took the leap. I use Gnome3 as the display manager.
- [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager): NixOS handles the OS level config, while Home Manager handles the user and my application config. Maybe one day I will open source these configs. :)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/): My current note taking system. Tried out notion, etc but this felt like the one, and was able to stick to it!
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): For mesh networking across devices. If there is only one piece of software that I would recommend. It would be this.
- [1password](https://1password.com/): For password management. Would definitely recommend this.
- [OhmyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh/): Zsh and Oh My Zsh for the Shell. Along with [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) as the terminal emulator.
- [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Current Editor. Really love using it because of all the awesome ecosystem and flexibility. Extensions that I can't live without
    - [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim): For all the Vim emulation.
    - [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github): Highly Recommended if your company/project is using GitHub.
    - [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): Awesome abstraction for Git. Very useful with interactive rebase, and Git Intellisense in the editor.
    - [Github Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.github): Primary Themes.
    - [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens): Error Highlighting in the editor. Still can't understand how its not in-built into Vs Code.
    - [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker): Would make a lot of spelling mistakes if it wasn't for this extension.
