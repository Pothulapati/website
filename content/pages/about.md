Hey! My Name is Tarun Pothulapati, Currently, I work at [Buoyant](https://www.buoyant.io), where I focus on [Linkerd](https://www.linkerd.io) which is a CNCF incubated service mesh project.

I enjoy learning/working on underlying technologies i.e systems, networking (duh), infra, etc.
Usually we don't really think about them until they break, which is pretty awesome, right?
A thing that we don't notice until it breaks, feels like magic.

You can see me posting on twitter at [@Pothulapati](https://twitter.com/Pothulapati) about tech mostly, and life in Hyderabad, India working remotely. :)

My resume can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_59nnsxicU_e9v3B0eI7JnXl0ooNNHtV/view)

Feel free to reach me out on opportunities, suggestions & feedback. :)
