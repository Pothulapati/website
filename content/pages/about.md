Hey! My Name is Tarun Pothulapati, Currently, I work at [DragonflyDB](https://www.dragonflydb.io), where I work on deployments of Dragonfly specifically the [Managed Offering](https://www.dragonflydb.io/cloud).

Before this, I was in the self-hosted team of [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io), where I worked on making Gitpod self-hosted and some other things possible.

And before that, I was a maintainer of [Linkerd](https://www.linkerd.io) working at [Buoyant](https://buoyant.io).

I enjoy learning/working on underlying technologies i.e systems, networking (duh), infra, etc.
Usually we don't really think about them until they break, which is pretty awesome, right?
A thing that we don't notice until it breaks, feels like magic.

You can see me posting on twitter at [@tarrooon](https://twitter.com/tarrooon) about tech mostly, and life in Hyderabad, India working remotely. :)

My resume can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_59nnsxicU_e9v3B0eI7JnXl0ooNNHtV/view)

Feel free to reach me out on opportunities, suggestions & feedback. :)
